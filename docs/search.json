    "text": "Basic model structure\nWe consider a basic dynamic model with a Markovian structure, in which the state of each year is dependent on the state of the previous year. Transition probabilities (the probability of a site going from one state to another, or remaining in the same state the following year) are determined as functions of colonization and survival rates.\nWe start by determining the initial state for each site \\(i\\), which follows a multinomial distribution:\n\\[\nz_{i,1} \\sim Categorical(\\Omega_i)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Omega_i\\) is the state vector, with the probabilities of each site \\(i\\) being in one of the states (\\(1,2,3\\)) on the first year (\\(t=1\\)), given by:\n\\[\n\\Omega_i = [\\phi_1 \\quad \\phi_2 \\quad \\phi_3]\n\\] The probability of a site being empty or unoccupied (state \\(1\\)) the first year is given by \\(\\phi_1\\), the probability of site \\(i\\) having a few bats or many bats the first year is given by \\(\\phi_2\\) and \\(\\phi_3\\) respectively, where the subscript indicates the state. Since the probabilities have to add up to 1, we can write the state vector probabilities in terms of one another, we reparameterize to:\n\\[\n\\Omega_i = [1-\\psi \\quad \\psi(1-r) \\quad \\psi r]_i\n\\] where \\(\\psi\\) is the probability of a site being occupied and \\(r\\) is the probability of an occupied site having many bats, thus the probability that a site is occupied with a few bats (\\(\\psi(1-r)\\)) is equivalent to the probability that a sites is occupied (\\(\\psi\\)) AND it is not occupied by many bats (\\(1-r\\)).\nThe state of each site \\(i\\) in the following years (\\(t = 2 \\dots T\\)) is given by:\n\\[\nz_{i,t}|z_{i,t-1} \\sim Categorical(\\Phi_{z{(t-1)}, z{(t)}, i, t})\n\\] where the transition matrix determines the probabilities of a site going from one state to another, or remaining in the same state, depending on the state it was in on the previous year:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{z{(t-1)}, z{(t)}, i,t} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n                                \\pi_{11} & \\pi_{12} & \\pi_{13} \\\\\n                                \\pi_{21} & \\pi_{22} & \\pi_{23} \\\\\n                                \\pi_{31} & \\pi_{32} & \\pi_{33}\n                                \\end{bmatrix}_{i,t}\n\\] we can read \\(\\pi_{n,m,i,t}\\) as the probability that site \\(i\\) transitions from state \\(n\\) in year \\(t-1\\) to state \\(m\\) in year \\(t\\). We reparameterize this transition matrix in terms of colonization (\\(\\gamma\\)) and persistence (\\(\\phi\\)), plus growth \\(G\\) or decline \\(D\\) when moving between the states of few and many bats.\n\\[\n\\Phi_{z{(t-1)}, z{(t)}} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n                                1-\\gamma & \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n                                1-\\phi_1 & \\phi_1(1-G) &  \\phi_1G\\\\\n                                1-\\phi_2 & \\phi_2D & \\phi_2(1 - D)\n                                \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nBoth the initial state vector \\(\\Omega_i\\) and the transition matrix \\(\\Phi\\) can be reparameterized in order to have these probabilities in terms of environmental covariates, which can then be modified by different management actions."
