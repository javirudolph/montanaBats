    "text": "Summary\nPhase 2 focused on analyzing acoustic data to model bat activity, and to avoid misidentification, they focused on overall bat activity (total number of bat calls). I think this work also used data from detectors placed for specific projects, and so not a probabilistic sampling design of Montana. Data from April to October since that’s when the bats are most active, and at least 15 nights for a detector.\n\nModel\nThe number of bat calls in a night modeled as a Poisson variable (\\(y_i\\), where \\(i\\) is one night at a specific detector), so use a generalized linear model to describe this and associated covariates. They model here detector years (\\(j\\)), which I don’t fully understand. The report mentions it groups observations if they were collected at the same detector during the same year. Anyways, the glm goes as follows\n\\[\n\\text{bat calls per night - } y_i \\sim Poisson(\\lambda_i)\n\\] log link to associate the mean (\\(\\lambda\\)) parameter,\n\\[\n\\log(\\lambda_i) = \\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{\\alpha}_{j[i]} + \\mathbf{w}_i\\mathbf{\\beta}_{j[i]}+\\epsilon_i\n\\] where the first part is for the weather covariates (air temp, wind speed, humidity, plus the intercept so \\(\\alpha\\) length is 4), the second is for a trend over time (using thin plate regression splines, is this a gam?), and the third for the error term for each night. The second part for the trend, \\(w\\) is a spline design matrix for julian date (this matrix has 10 columns, and thus length of \\(\\beta\\) is 10). Coefficients (\\(\\alpha \\text{ and } \\beta\\)) could vary across detector years (or just years? why use detector years?). They also model each batch of coefficients (each batch is a year) with normal distributions. To include variation, they use a hierarchical framework and have the coefficients follow normal distributions: \\[\n\\alpha_{jk} \\sim \\mathit{Normal}(\\mu_{\\alpha k}, \\sigma_{\\alpha k}^2)\n\\]\n\n\nResults\nThe zipfolder had data and scripts, and I was able to run the model to get the results. I have stored those in the same shapefiles directory, but these are not on github due to size. For the \\(alpha\\) coefficients (\\(\\alpha_{jk} \\sim \\mathit{Normal}(\\mu_{\\alpha k}, \\sigma_{\\alpha k}^2)\\)) overall intercept it 3, and posterior mean for \\(\\sigma\\) is 2.25, air temp has positive relationship with nightly number of calls. Humidity and wind speed with negative relationship. Figure 3 in the report shows more details, which I reproduced below.\n\nShared data\nI ran this model using the code provided by Kathi, but it is not on Github because of size.\n\n\n\nQuick look at the data\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots show the number of observations (total nights) for each of these sites, and the three habitat covariates they had available.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the nightly covariates they used in the model, and the ones associated to the alpha coefficients. They didn’t use the environmental covariates because there was not enough variation in those.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the parameters for the normal distributions that describe the coefficients for all the covariates. After running the model, I used the available code to reproduce the figure shown in the report."

What is relevant to us, is that they simulate data for bat occupancy in Montana using the coefficients from Phase 1. I only got the report associated to this work, but no data or scripts. This report cites the data release and the report mentioned in Phase 1 to inform the detection and occupancy parameters in all their simulations.\nThey mention here a package: DynOccuPow by Banner et al 2019 to generate occupancy datasets but I haven’t had a chance to explore it.\n\nSingle-season model\nTo simulate these, it is straightforward using the covariates mentioned in Phase 1, although we don’t have the data for those covariates. So a site \\(i\\) is either occupied or not with probability \\(\\psi_i\\) following: \\[\nZ_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\psi_i)\n\\]\nand, \\[\n\\text{logit}(\\psi_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\log \\text{_Forest}_i + \\beta_2\\text{Ruggedness}_i + \\beta_3\\text{Elevation}_i + \\beta_4\\text{DegreeDays}_i\n\\] In the report they mention that for MYLU, these coefficients are: \\(\\beta_0 = 2, \\beta_1 = 0, \\beta_2 = -0.25, \\beta_3 = 1, \\beta_4 = 2\\) and a constant detection probability of 0.378 and generated for visits \\(j = 1, ..., J\\): \\[\n[Y_{ij}|Z_i=1]\\sim\\text{Bernoulli}(p_{ij})\n\\] with \\(logit(p_{ij}) = \\alpha_0\\) and \\(\\alpha_0 = -0.5\\)\n\nMulti-season model\nsimulated data for \\(t = 1,2,3\\) years, and data for the first year was simulated following the single-season model described above.For subsequent years, occupancy was generated based on colonization and survival rates given the occupancy of the previous year. So, occupancy states \\(Z_{i,t}\\) for \\(t=2,3\\) are \\(\\text{Bernoulli}(\\psi_{i,t})\\) with:\n\\[\n\\psi_{i,t} = z_{i,t-1}\\phi_{t-1} + (1- z_{i,t-1})\\gamma_{t-1}\n\\] which means cells that were occupied in the previous year remain occupied with probability \\(\\phi\\) and cells that were empty the previous year get occupied with probabilty \\(\\gamma\\). Values used here: \\(\\gamma = 0.1\\) representing low colonization rate, and used values of \\(\\phi_1 = 0.9\\) and declines with \\(\\phi_2 = 0.9 \\times d\\) with \\(d = (0.975, 0.95, 0.9)\\) to simulate occupancy declines in 15, 20, and 25%. For detections, they used \\(\\alpha_0 = -0.8\\) which gave a detection probability of 0.310, constant.\n\n\n\nActivity model\nThis one uses the model and coefficients from Phase 2 and generates data."

    "text": "We fitted a series of multistate multiscale occupancy models to bat call data provided by the state of Montana. The data provided was not species-specific but was associated to a frequency of bat calls known to be susceptible to white nose syndrome. These models allowed us to evaluate the impact of environmental covariates on the likelihood of bat occupancy at multiple abundance levels. In this context, multistate refers to three levels of bat activity: no bats, few bats, and many bats. On the other hand, multiscale refers to the fact that each grid cell that was sampled had multiple sites sampled over a certain number of nights.\nThe multistate aspect of the models allows us to understand not just if bats are present, but also how many bats are present, without fitting an abundance model. We were able to consider several variables that might affect the likelihood of bat occupancy, such as temperature, humidity, forest cover, and elevation, following the regional model published by NABat.\nOverall, our analysis using these multistate multiscale occupancy models has allowed us to gain a base understanding of the factors affecting bat occupancy in Montana, which we can use to generate base predictive models that incorporate different management strategies that support and protect bat populations in the state."

    "text": "Model description cont.\nWe consider a simple dynamic model with potential occupancy states for each site \\(i\\): unoccupied, few bats, many bats. The probability of each site \\(i\\) being in one of those occupancy states at time \\(t\\) is given by a combination of the state of the site in the last year \\(t-1\\) and some environmental covariates.\nWith \\(z_i,t\\) being the state of site \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\), drawn from a multinomial distribution with a vector of probabilities for each state. Given the dependency on the state of the previous year, we define the state of sites in the first year separately as:\n\\[\nz_{i,1} \\sim \\text{Categorical}(\\Omega_i)\n\\] The initial state vector (\\(\\Omega_i\\)) gives the probability of a site \\(i\\) being in one of the three states: unoccupied (coded as 1), few bats (coded as 2), many bats (coded at 3), and is a combination of the probability of a site being occupied (\\(\\psi\\)) and the probability that an occupied site is occupied by many bats (\\(r\\)).\n\\[\n\\Omega_i = [1-\\psi \\quad \\psi(1-r) \\quad \\psi r]_i\n\\] For us to relate these two probabilities (\\(\\psi\\) and \\(r\\)) to covariates, we use a logit link as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{logit}(\\psi) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 ForestCover\n\\\\\n\\text{logit}(r) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 CaveDensity\n\\]\nIn this simple example, we have only added one covariate to each probability. Therefore, we establish that the probability of a site being occupied by bats in the first year is a function of percent forest cover, and the probability that those occupied sites are occupied by many bats is a function of cave density.\nThe state of each site \\(i\\) in the following years (\\(t = 2 \\dots T\\)) is given by:\n\\[\nz_{i,t}|z_{i,t-1} \\sim Categorical(\\Phi_{z{(t-1)}, z{(t)}, i, t})\n\\] where the transition matrix (\\(\\Phi\\)) determines the probabilities of a site going from one state to another, or remaining in the same state, depending on covariates and the state at time \\(t-1\\). We have parameterized the transition matrix in terms of colonization, persistence, growth, and decline:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{z{(t-1)}, z{(t)}, i,t} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n                                1-\\gamma & \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n                                1-\\phi_1 & \\phi_1(1-G) &  \\phi_1G\\\\\n                                1-\\phi_2 & \\phi_2D & \\phi_2(1 - D)\n                                \\end{bmatrix}_{i,t}\n\\] Where \\(\\gamma\\) parameters are state specific. This means \\(\\gamma\\) is the probability of an empty site at time \\(t-1\\) being colonized by few bats at time \\(t\\). We assume empty sites cannot be colonized by many bats in one time step. Persistence (\\(\\phi\\)) describes the probability of a site staying in the same state from one year to another. Growth and decline probabilities are shown by \\(G\\) and \\(D\\).\nFor us to relate the rates in the transition matrix to covariates and management actions, we use a logit-link."

    "section": "Bat survival to WNS in different regions of Montana",
    "text": "Bat survival to WNS in different regions of Montana\nWhite Nose Syndrome (WNS), a fungal disease of bats caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), was detected in seven species of bats in eastern Montana in 2020-2021, and showed spread towards the west. Although the effects of WNS can be devastating to bat populations in the eastern United States, there is uncertainty regarding the risk for bats in Montana. There exists the possibility that bats in the west, in Montana, would face a similar population decline as in the eastern part of the United States. However, it is also possible that bats in Montana have a different outcome with Pd infection due to their genetics or the topographic ruggedness of their environment. Due to the landscape characteristics in Montana, bat behavior is also different and roosting occurs at lower densities across the landscape, perhaps altering the pathogen’s effect on bat populations.\nGiven the uncertainty in the outcome for bat populations infected with Pd we performed an expert elicitation session with 9 experts for bat populations in the western areas of the United States. We started a two hour discussion by asking the experts about all the potential factors that could play into Pd infections and determine bat survival. Several experts mentioned that they believed Pd would cause less drastic effects on western bat populations due to the landscape, since bats are spread out and not clustered in caves or mines. There was also concern regarding the lack of identified hibernacula in the west, and the uncertainty of how Pd would be transmitted in these rocky environments, in contrast to the known behavior associated to hibernacula humid conditions. Additionally, comparisons between the east and west areas for pathogen spread have shown slower spread in the west. A potential explanation is the topographic diversity that limits how bats move around and might spread the fungus.\nGiven the importance of the landscape, we asked experts to independently make predictions as to the effect of WNS on bat survival across three different biogegraphic regions in Montana (as shown in the map below). These three regions are based on the continental divide and rocky mountain front on the west, the northeastern area defined by everything north of the mountain ranges, and the southern region encompassing the xeric pine forest mountains and sagebrush steppe.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used a standardized protocol for the expert elicitation where we developed a training question, and three additional questions regarding bat survival to WNS in the three biogeographic regions of Montana. We performed a four-point elicitation, in which each expert independently gave the lowest, highest, and best point estimates for the number of bats that would die due to WNS. The fourth point corresponded to the confindence each expert associated to their generated interval and how it would capture the true value for bat deaths. We discussed the experts estimates individually their aggregated distributions. OVerall, we observed that there was a lot of variation between the experts and across regions. Although during the discussion section of the process, it was mentioned that Pd might have less drastic effects for bats in the west, the estimates provided by the experts still show high probabilities of bats succumbing to the disease (median aggregated probabilities shown below each Plot2 for each question). Additionally, there is a big overlap in the estimates across regions, with the west region with slightly lower probabilities for bats dying from WNS, something that was mentioned in the discussion as being associated to the ruggedness of the terrain."

    "text": "Training and Expert Calibration\n\n\n\nDuring our expert elicitation session, we used the first part of the meeting to explain the process to all the experts. We used presented a training question regarding the average size tip to tail for the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus. Several experts noted that this is not a common measurement that they are used to thinking about, given that when capturing bats they consider forearm length. We adjusted the question to the bat measurement from tip to base of tail, and asked experts to use their knowledge on other measurements, such as forearm length, to estimate the average size of a bat measured from head to base of the tail. The reference for the true value is the Montana Field Guide which listed the length of head and body from 41-54mm, thus we used the middle value of 47.5 as the truth. Based on the expert responses, 5 out of the 9 experts captured this true value within the intervals they provided, with varying degrees of confidence. Using the experts’ confidence, we calculated the expected number of experts that would have captured the true value for bat size within the interval they provided (6.45)."
