    "text": "We fitted a series of multistate multiscale occupancy models to bat call data provided by the state of Montana. The data provided was not species-specific but was associated to a frequency of bat calls known to be susceptible to white nose syndrome. These models allowed us to evaluate the impact of environmental covariates on the likelihood of bat occupancy at multiple abundance levels. In this context, multistate refers to three levels of bat activity: no bats, few bats, and many bats. On the other hand, multiscale refers to the fact that each grid cell that was sampled had multiple sites sampled over a certain number of nights.\nThe multistate aspect of the models allows us to understand not just if bats are present, but also how many bats are present, without fitting an abundance model. We were able to consider several variables that might affect the likelihood of bat occupancy, such as temperature, humidity, forest cover, and elevation, following the regional model published by NABat.\nOverall, our analysis using these multistate multiscale occupancy models has allowed us to gain a base understanding of the factors affecting bat occupancy in Montana, which we can use to generate base predictive models that incorporate different management strategies that support and protect bat populations in the state."

    "section": "Bat survival to WNS in different regions of Montana",
    "text": "Bat survival to WNS in different regions of Montana\nWhite Nose Syndrome (WNS), a fungal disease of bats caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), was detected in seven species of bats in eastern Montana in 2020-2021, and showed spread towards the west. Although the effects of WNS can be devastating to bat populations in the eastern United States, there is uncertainty regarding the risk for bats in Montana. There exists the possibility that bats in the west, in Montana, would face a similar population decline as in the eastern part of the United States. However, it is also possible that bats in Montana have a different outcome with Pd infection due to their genetics or the topographic ruggedness of their environment. Due to the landscape characteristics in Montana, bat behavior is also different and roosting occurs at lower densities across the landscape, perhaps altering the pathogen’s effect on bat populations.\nGiven the uncertainty in the outcome for bat populations infected with Pd we performed an expert elicitation session with 9 experts for bat populations in the western areas of the United States. We started a two hour discussion by asking the experts about all the potential factors that could play into Pd infections and determine bat survival. Several experts mentioned that they believed Pd would cause less drastic effects on western bat populations due to the landscape, since bats are spread out and not clustered in caves or mines. There was also concern regarding the lack of identified hibernacula in the west, and the uncertainty of how Pd would be transmitted in these rocky environments, in contrast to the known behavior associated to hibernacula humid conditions. Additionally, comparisons between the east and west areas for pathogen spread have shown slower spread in the west. A potential explanation is the topographic diversity that limits how bats move around and might spread the fungus.\nGiven the importance of the landscape, we asked experts to independently make predictions as to the effect of WNS on bat survival across three different biogegraphic regions in Montana (as shown in the map below). These three regions are based on the continental divide and rocky mountain front on the west, the northeastern area defined by everything north of the mountain ranges, and the southern region encompassing the xeric pine forest mountains and sagebrush steppe.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used a standardized protocol for the expert elicitation where we developed a training question, and three additional questions regarding bat survival to WNS in the three biogeographic regions of Montana. We performed a four-point elicitation, in which each expert independently gave the lowest, highest, and best point estimates for the number of bats that would die due to WNS. The fourth point corresponded to the confindence each expert associated to their generated interval and how it would capture the true value for bat deaths. We discussed the experts estimates individually their aggregated distributions. OVerall, we observed that there was a lot of variation between the experts and across regions. Although during the discussion section of the process, it was mentioned that Pd might have less drastic effects for bats in the west, the estimates provided by the experts still show high probabilities of bats succumbing to the disease (median aggregated probabilities shown below each Plot2 for each question). Additionally, there is a big overlap in the estimates across regions, with the west region with slightly lower probabilities for bats dying from WNS, something that was mentioned in the discussion as being associated to the ruggedness of the terrain."

We used presented a training question regarding the average size tip to tail for the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus. Several experts noted that this is not a common measurement that they are used to thinking about, given that when capturing bats they consider forearm length. We adjusted the question to the bat measurement from tip to base of tail, and asked experts to use their knowledge on other measurements, such as forearm length, to estimate the average size of a bat measured from head to base of the tail. The reference for the true value is the Montana Field Guide which listed the length of head and body from 41-54mm, thus we used the middle value of 47.5 as the truth. Based on the expert responses, 5 out of the 9 experts captured this true value within the intervals they provided, with varying degrees of confidence. Using the experts’ confidence, we calculated the expected number of experts that would have captured the true value for bat size within the interval they provided (6.45)."
